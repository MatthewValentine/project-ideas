# No computer project

What I have chosen for my no-computer language is EMOTICONS.
You may point out that emoticons ARE computer-based! But I argue that there is
a meta-language, which can be used just as well in handwriting and in print,
that computer-based emoticons try to mimic. That language, which I'm still
calling emoticons, is essentially the idea of putting smileys and things in-line
with other written text. So, that does not include full-scale drawings.

## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.



### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_

Emoticons allow people to more accurately describe their emotions over text-based communication.
It is difficult without emoticons to concisely and accurately without nonverbal communication, 
and arguably they are a better replacement
for nonverbal communication than simply taking a long time to describe your feelings is.

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

Users are already in the context of communicating by writing. Emoticons as a DSL fit inside
of that paradigm, so it is very easy for users to use, and easier to understand when
first seeing them because they 

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

It is interesting because it is decidedly NOT unambiguous.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Communicating nonverbal signals in writing.

### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_ 

A program 

### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

A reader interprets the emoticons they see, using the context they have of what various
faces and movements mean, to understand the intended nonverbal signals. It is very easy
to misunderstand these emoticons, especially without knowing what they are! 
Therefore, it is often necessary that
the emoticon match up with a particular normal-text clarification, such as LOL, to avoid errors.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be very easy to express common nonverbal signals, such as :), xD, :( and :P.
It should be impossible to break the general written form. Once full-scale drawings are allowed,
the varieties of text-based communication that can use emoticons become more limited.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

Drawings and ASCII art are heavily related, but break the written form more.

## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

Virtually ALL of the work is on the language side, as the idea is that the systems
are already fixed.

### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

It is as ambitious as trying to understand the totality of the human condition.

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea 
project?_

This would be a good project because the work would be all about the language,
and you would be trying to concisely describe extremely complex ideas.
This would be a bad project in that most of the work has already been done by other people.
